# The Green Tree

The green Tree is a website for selling green plants, that I made as my third term semester project at Noroff. 

## Description

It was the first big project where I used Bootstrap, Sass, and Strapi, though I only used Strapi locally at the time. I later uploaded my Strapi to Heroku, using Cloudinary to store images.

My favorite things about this project:
- Working with Sass. I found I liked it, and I've used it for most projects since
- Working with the API. API is one of my favorite things to work with as a front-end developer (though it also can be frustrating at times :sweat_smile:)

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- Heroku
- Sass

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmmaTonnessen/the-green-tree-semester-project-2.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

### Running

Make sure you're watching the Sass, and open with your live server. Simple as that.
